# Tweetification

Work in progress. The frontend is not completely ready yet. Backend is available in this repository.

Suppose you want to be notified everytime a certain user (your choice) posts a tweet with a certain keyword in it (your choice).
This web app does exactly that. You enter a keyword, a username, and your email address. Now, everytime that user posts a tweet which
has that keyword, you'll receive an email from that app notifying you about that text and other relevant details.

Again, this is not ready yet. I am working on it. Feel free to fork.
